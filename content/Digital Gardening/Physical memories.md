I've always wanted to collect physical memories of the people and places dear to me, but film cameras are honestly too much of an investment for me to commit to right now, and I never got around to buying a polaroid either. So I take to creating vlogs and reels and instagram highlights of them instead.

Every so often though I keep a flyer, a postcard, or a ticket stub to remind me of these things. Like this postcard I bought at the Red Brick Warehouse in Yokohama on a date with my girlfriend recently:

We had dinner at a restaurant with a glass wall looking on to the adjacent warehouse basically *exactly* like in the illustration, so I was stoked to have found this on the way out. 

I don't keep a scrapbook or anything (yet), so for now these are just hanging around somewhere safe until the lucky future moment I stumble upon them again to remember all the good times.
