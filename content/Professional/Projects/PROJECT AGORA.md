> [!hint] Abstract
> **PROJECT AGORA** is a social and technical project aimed at creating a *"third place"* specifically catered to aesthetes who are looking for a community and space to practice and demonstrate their artistic outlets and nurture a creative and meaningful section of their lives that is separate from home and work (that is, the *first and second place*). 

## Introduction
This project begins with an idea I had when reading about the "Third Place Theory" (*see: [[Project Agora - The Concept]]*). The objective is to create a community of like-minded people who want to carve out a portion of their lives to pursue and indulge in hobbies and interests of aesthetic value, and find a community and space to decompress from the often overwhelming presence of their *first and second places* - home and work. 

This **third place** aims at being one without responsibility, and that doesn't demand value to be extracted from your artistic pursuits. Whether you want to consume art and literature, create it, or discuss it with peers, there's a place for you at the Agora.
