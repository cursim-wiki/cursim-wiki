> [!hint] Abstract
> **PROJECT AGORA** is a social and technical project aimed at creating a *"third place"* specifically catered to aesthetes who are looking for a community and space to practice and demonstrate their artistic outlets and nurture a creative and meaningful section of their lives that is separate from home and work (that is, the *first and second place*). 

## Introduction
This project begins with an idea I had when reading about the "Third Place Theory" (*see: [[Project Agora - The Concept]]*). The objective is to create a community of like-minded people who want to carve out a portion of their lives to pursue and indulge in hobbies and interests of aesthetic value, and find a community and space to decompress from the often overwhelming presence of their *first and second places* - home and work. 

This **third place** aims at being one without responsibility, and that doesn't demand value to be extracted from your artistic pursuits. Whether you want to consume art and literature, create it, or discuss it with peers, there's a place for you at the Agora.

## Community 
Agora is thus far just an excuse to gather those interested in aesthetic pursuit via events and workshops, but I also want to build it into a community that's self-sustained, and can easily expand into new chapters across cities and countries. 

#### Social Media
If you want to build a community, you need strong socials, there's no two ways about it. Since project agora is aiming to cater specifically to aesthetes and lovers of art and literature, I'm going to have to put considerable effort into creating a pleasing and culture-rich Instagram+Facebook page to attract new members, and put out content for the down-periods without events.

#### Events - Tokyo Chapter
I'll start with Tokyo, of course, since that's where I'm currently based. Luckily, Tokyo has a lot of public locations that are perfect for meeting up and hanging out at no additional cost beyond the commute there - one could say that Tokyo has a lot of agoras already, and that makes it possible to set up events and meet-ups in several locations, maybe even a new one every time.

Some basic events I'd like to start with are Poetry Exchange/Readings, Art Journalling, City Photography Excursions, and Open Mics. Since the range of activities are pretty widely varied, it'll help bring in people with varied interests, although I run the risk of low repeat-participants if the event types are too far-apart and disconnected.

#### International?
Once a solid social media presence, website, and event flow has been established, it shouldn't take any extraordinary effort to open up chapters in other cities where I have trusted liaisons to carry out the events. Bangalore comes to mind as an obvious choice, being my home city in India, and the fact that there's no shortage of literature and art lovers - it's a very culturally rich city; plus I have friends there who might be excited to take up this endeavor for the Bangalore chapter too.

## Website
The website makes up the only technical part of the project, but there's a large deal of UI/UX considerations that I need to carefully make to ensure that the site I make actually does the job of attracting *aesthetes*. I'll start with outlining the user flow for a very simple website that conveys the project's objective, provides an overview of events and links to socials, and hooks the attention of those with a refined taste in both UI design and social events.
