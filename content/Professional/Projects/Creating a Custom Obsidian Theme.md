## Introduction
I wanted to get involved in some sort of open-source project, but I had no idea where to start. To make meaningful contributions to OSS, you need to be familiar with the application and use of said software - but out of all the tools and software I use in my projects every day, all of them felt too daunting to dive into the development of!
And so, I decided upon a simpler stepping-stone for my foray into OSS development - to create a custom visual theme; and what better application to start off theming for, than Obsidian, my favorite note-taking tool on this planet!
