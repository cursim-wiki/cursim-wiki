# 🛠️ Skills
### Javascript & TypeScript
My ‘native’ programming language, I’ve worked with it for over 4 years. I’ve used it in the front-end with React and Vue.js, in the back-end for APIs with NestJS, etc.
### Python
I’ve used python extensively in several university projects and internships and have applied it to projects spanning several fields such as web development, AI/ML, and Data Science.
### UI/UX
I’ve been very interested and involved with User Experience Design for the last 2 years and have done a specialization course on it provided by Google & Coursera.
