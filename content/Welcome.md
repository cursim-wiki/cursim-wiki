Welcome to my blog.
I'm Akash Bagchi. A software developer currently working in Tokyo, Japan. 
At the time of writing, I'm planning to create a sort-of wiki to my professional and creative portfolio, as well as potentially use this as a knowledge-base for me to document and share the things I learn. But truth be told, only time will tell how this evolves.

#### Table of Contents
- Professional
	- [[Resume]]
	- Projects
		- [[Professional/Projects/README|README]]
- Blog
	- [[What's with B2B UX?]]
