I found this cool pomodoro timer app for the Mac and iOS recently, called Session. I've only used it some 3 days so far, so I can't say with certainty that it's objectively better than any other pomodoro app out there, but I'm liking it.

It has great integrations with the apple calendar, and has a built-in way to block apps, write reflections after focus sessions, etc.

All-in-all it's just another way to try and direct your focus and effort in planned, organized effort instead or random, short-lived bursts of productivity; and I thought I'd write a quick note about it. (thinking it would be cool if I could eventually have a whole collection of cool tools, apps, and resources to refer back to at any time).
