Decided to make a quick and short addendum to [[Organizing My Thoughts | my previous note about the new tag system.]] I thought it might be as simple as adding the new tags to existing notes where applicable but I very quickly started to feel it didn't quite fit in certain places - the blog posts in particular.

While the structured, polished format is definitely in the realm of the #odyssey tag or at least #expedition , I still feel like as if it's something else entirely. So for a temporary (or permanent, idk) solution, I added another #blog tag to categorize those neatly into what I feel they are -> blog posts, nothing more or less.

I guess it's hard to reconcile something explicitly formatted as a blog post with something organic (or stemming from organic ideas and thoughts) like an 'odyssey' note.
