I've been thinking about how to better organize my thoughts to truly turn this into a *digital garden*, and I realized that I've been pretty narrowly restricted in the scope of what I could publish here - namely blogs, project write-ups, and professional portfolio stuff.

But I want more; I don't want to have to wait a month before I've finally curated, formatted, and edited an entire blog post worth of information before being able to document it in my garden, because this will inevitably lead to a loss of information (because my memory simply sucks), and also introduces a certain degree of disingenuity - since I don't actually have thoughts in a blog post format.

So I've decided to introduce some new tags (and note types) to help expand on this digital garden in a more organic way, in the theme of *'Journey'*
1. #footprint ->  Small, initial thoughts
2. #trail -> Emerging ideas ond
3. #expedition -> Well developed, but evolving ideas
4. #odyssey -> Comprehensive blog posts or extensive projects

I'm not sure yet how to unify this new tag convention with the existing project and life/tech blog categories I was using so far, but for now I'll start by attaching these where applicable; indeed some notes might require categorization as something else altogether - #portfolio , for example.
