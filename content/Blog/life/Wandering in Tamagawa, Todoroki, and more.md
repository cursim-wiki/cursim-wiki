> I tend to spend most weekends just relaxing in my room to prepare for the upcoming week of work, so I end up not going out a lot. But recently I've been trying to change that by stepping out when the weather permits it at least, even for just a walk.
> 
> On this particular weekend, I headed out to Tamagawa river, and also walked to Todoroki Ravine Park and grabbed lunch at Jiyugaoka.

You've gotta make the most of the spring weather while it lasts. There's not much more to it.

> That being said, I hope you enjoy the video!
