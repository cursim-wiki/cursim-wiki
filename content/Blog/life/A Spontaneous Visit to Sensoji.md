## Why YouTube?
Put simply, it's because I personally enjoy consuming that sort of content, and so I feel quite a bit of satisfaction to produce the same kind of content myself. 

I've been taking a ton of videos since I came here anyway, and they keep filling up my phone to the point where I've had to clear out all my photos 3-4 times in the last 6 months. I originally started editing them into reels and uploading them to my private instagram, but then I realized that 
1. I hate short-form content.
2. I put too much attention into how others receive it.

What I really wanted was simply evidence of me making an effort to enjoy my time here, and I wanted it in a format I like to see from others.

## Sensoji at 11pm
Let me preface this by saying that I'm relatively lucky when it comes to working a full-time job in Japan because I don't have very strict timings or mandatory overtime. But the way that I've structured my basic routine, I usually end up leaving work at anywhere between 8-9 everyday. 

Pair this with the fact that a majority of stores, malls, etc. in Japan close by 10:30 at the latest, it leaves me with very little options to do anything other than just go home and relax. The parks and temples however, are often open 24 hours, and well lit too - nothing shady.

And so, in a bid to make more memories for myself, I set off one night after work to see what Sensoji is like so late at night.

I must say I'm glad I did it. Not only did it help me get out of the monotony of work>rest>work>rest>,,, mentally, it also gave me a new creative outlet and something to pass my time with. 

There's already a million articles and videos about this iconic Tokyo sightseeing spot, so I'll spare you the history lesson about Sensoji's significance. After all this random excursion was never about the sight, it was about being more spontaneous, and protesting the salaryman lifestyle.

## Reflections
When I made this whole decision to _live_ more and start a YouTube channel, I'd just come back from a 10 day holiday back home in India, and to be honest, I was struggling. Struggling to get back into the rhythm of working, struggling to cook and feed myself, to stay clean and active.

I'm glad I decided to break myself out of it, and I hope everyone in a similar situation to me (who there's definitely no lack of) can find something of their own to break the monotony and bring fulfilling memories back into their life.
