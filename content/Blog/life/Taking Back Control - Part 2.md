////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Starting off, I have a confession. My previous entry, "[[Taking Back Control]]" was one of the founding ideas that led to the creation of this blog, or [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) , so to speak. To me, there was significant meaning in this whole venture. This 'wiki', was just an excuse for me to start documenting and curating the knowledge I gathered from all sorts of sources, and in turn use them to _create_ something of myself. Emergent connections, patterns, an ever-growing knowledge-base, and ultimately - unprecedented personal growth.

That's what I had **hoped** for, at least. But the reality of the situation isn't ever that simple, is it... If anyone actually looked, they'd notice how updates to this blog all but ended about 3-4 weeks in, and it was all-set to becoming another one of my _started in earnest but never finished due to a general lack of direction and dedication to an end goal that I believed in_ type of projects.

And that in itself should answer some questions already. _Did I manage to take back control of my life since my last entry?_ No. _Did I try?_ Most definitely. _Was it worth anything?_ Perhaps the most important takeaway so far - yes, it was; and I don't think I'd have ever returned to make this follow-up if that weren't the case.

I've always been so uncertain and quite frankly scared about exactly what I can share with the outside world. The whole concept of a blog didn't entirely stick with me for this exact reason. It can often feel like I'm setting myself up for failure by putting it all out there for people can see; or, in a case such as this one where my main goal was to build something that grew in value and emergent connections the more I added to it - it felt like it would never really be '_ready_' to share, at least not until I had posted a LOT and gathered a whole bunch of knowledge.

But enough of that. With this post, and some other general refinements to this site, I'm going to be sharing it with the world, finally. With that said and done, let's go into some *serious* detail about my last 3 months attempting to change.

## What I set out to do
I set 4 goals for myself initially:
1. **Journaling** - I wanted to make an entry everyday - no matter how short. The idea was that by channeling my curiosity and creativity by means of digital disconnect, I might create something truly meaningful, at least at a personal level.
2. **Disconnect** - The aforementioned digital disconnect. The main barrier to claiming back our attention and minds today is without doubt to resist the temptation to succumb to infinite on-demand distraction.
3. **Exercise and Hygiene** - I wanted my physical health and wellbeing to thrive along with my mental, and also as a supplement to it. Exercise and general self-care has been tried and tested a million times over throughout human civilization, so that's what I set out to do.
4. **Tracking** - This one was certainly not as important, and more of something for myself to see if I could quantify the benefits this regime would bring me, but in essence I wanted to keep track of my efforts to the above and try to get some insight out of it.
Okay, so how did I fare? Let's dive in ðŸ¤¿

### Journaling
This was probably one of the most important bits for me. For one, there was the _curation and creation_ aspect, which was something the creator of the [video](https://youtu.be/zIu7PtT79uA) I embedded on the [[Taking Back Control | original post]] spoke about a lot; and, rather impressively, I **did** manage to do it everyday for a month

 I wrote about a lot of things, and a lot of times my entries would be just 2-3 lines long, but that was fine by me. At the time, despite my enthusiasm for the project, I wasn't quite as keen on as much of a _detailed_ logging of information as I am right now. Besides, there's seldom time between my day to day to dish out 3 paragraphs of nuanced thought for a daily journal entry.
