////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Starting off, I have a confession. My previous entry, "[[Taking Back Control]]" was one of the founding ideas that led to the creation of this blog, or [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) , so to speak. To me, there was significant meaning in this whole venture. This 'wiki', was just an excuse for me to start documenting and curating the knowledge I gathered from all sorts of sources, and in turn use them to _create_ something of myself. Emergent connections, patterns, an ever-growing knowledge-base, and ultimately - unprecedented personal growth.

That's what I had **hoped** for, at least. But the reality of the situation isn't ever that simple, is it... If anyone actually looked, they'd notice how updates to this blog all but ended about 3-4 weeks in, and it was all-set to becoming another one of my _started in earnest but never finished due to a general lack of direction and dedication to an end goal that I believed in_ type of projects.

And that in itself should answer some questions already. _Did I manage to take back control of my life since my last entry?_ No. _Did I try?_ Most definitely. _Was it worth anything?_ Perhaps the most important takeaway so far - yes, it was; and I don't think I'd have ever returned to make this follow-up if that weren't the case.

I've always been so uncertain and quite frankly scared about exactly what I can share with the outside world. The whole concept of a blog didn't entirely stick with me for this exact reason. It can often feel like I'm setting myself up for failure by putting it all out there for people can see; or, in a case such as this one where my main goal was to build something that grew in value and emergent connections the more I added to it - it felt like it would never really be '_ready_' to share, at least not until I had posted a LOT and gathered a whole bunch of knowledge.

But enough of that. With this post, and some other general refinements to this site, I'm going to be sharing it with the world, finally. With that said and done, let's go into some *serious* detail about my last 3 months attempting to change.

## What I set out to do
I set 4 goals for myself initially:
1. **Journaling** - I wanted to make an entry everyday - no matter how short. The idea was that by channeling my curiosity and creativity by means of digital disconnect, I might create something truly meaningful, at least at a personal level.
2. **Disconnect** - The aforementioned digital disconnect. The main barrier to claiming back our attention and minds today is without doubt to resist the temptation to succumb to infinite on-demand distraction.
3. **Exercise and Hygiene** - I wanted my physical health and wellbeing to thrive along with my mental, and also as a supplement to it. Exercise and general self-care has been tried and tested a million times over throughout human civilization, so that's what I set out to do.
4. **Tracking** - This one was certainly not as important, and more of something for myself to see if I could quantify the benefits this regime would bring me, but in essence I wanted to keep track of my efforts to the above and try to get some insight out of it.
Okay, so how did I fare? Let's dive in ðŸ¤¿

### Journaling
This was probably one of the bits that was a huge goal for me. For one, there was the _curation and creation_ aspect, which was something the creator of the [video](https://youtu.be/zIu7PtT79uA) I embedded on the [[Taking Back Control | original post]] spoke about a lot and that I wanted to nurture in myself; and, rather impressively, I **did** manage to do it everyday for a month

 I wrote about a lot of things, and a lot of times my entries would be just 2-3 lines long, but that was fine by me. At the time, despite my enthusiasm for the project, I wasn't quite as keen on as much of a _detailed_ logging of information as I am right now. Besides, there's seldom time between my day to day to dish out 3 paragraphs of nuanced thought for a daily journal entry.
 
 Every entry would have at the very least, logs of whether I did a digital disconnect that day, how long I slept the previous night, and a percentage rating of my mood for the day. This was of course, to facilitate the tracking bit, but also to give a minimum content template to what goes into these entries.
 
 Beyond the first month though, things fell off quite quickly. July saw me make an entry on only 10/31 days. A quick reading of the entries reminds me that I had some emotional trouble; My girlfriend and I have been long-distance since I moved to Japan for this job, and there's been some very major effects on the way I processed and coped with my emotions. 
 
 Unfortunately, one of the most major ones has been that I tend to shut down any habit streaks, participation in group activities and socializing in general, and it becomes very difficult for me to direct my energy into anything other than thinking. For that reason, I think I should've predicted that my next lull emotionally would need special consideration in this whole attempt to change my life. But I digress, to speak about how August after that, there were **zero** entries lol.
 
 That said, I don't see it as a complete failure either, because that's just how life is, and I actually took up something else in its stead - reading. After many years of being unable to finish a book, I decided _something_ had to be done about my mind running to all the places I didn't want it to, and bought some books instead.

 Over July and August, I finished the 3 books pictured above, and have since been working on [_Yeat's Poetry, Drama, and Prose_](https://wwnorton.com/books/Yeatss-Poetry-Drama-and-Prose). I've loved taking up reading again, and it's been a pretty unexpected result from this whole exercise; and I do say that it's a direct result of this exercise, for reasons that I'll get into in the next section.

### Disconnect
My next effort was to actively practice _disconnecting_; and I don't mean simply turning off cellular and listening to my offline playlists either. No, I know myself too well, and I would absolutely find some horrible offline application to keep my brain pacified instead of let myself think organic thoughts. So for me, I decided to use my commute time everyday (1 hour both ways, 2 hours total) to just put my phone and earphones away in my bag and not even check so much as the notification banners.

And believe me when I say, it was probably the most positive change overall for me in my life. _Mom was right all along, it was the damn phones._ Of course, **this** was one of the main points that the video I referenced last time was making - we need to teach ourselves how to detach from the constant onslaught of information and distractions, and cultivate a _healthy diet_ of content that we can mindfully consume, without paying with our sanity and critical thinking ability.

In June, I clearly didn't do it everyday; in fact it comes up to just 13/30 days. Looking at this, I initially thought I had failed horribly, but looking inwards at my consumption habits, I think it's rather been a huge success. For starters, I want to clear right away that it didn't entirely reduce my screen time. While I _was_ avoiding those 2 hours a day of phone usage on weekdays, I'd usually make that time up by using it longer at night to catch up with all the texts and other events that I'd missed.

I did however, gain in some pretty significant ways mentally. One being, I actually started to have thoughts again! It might sound a bit silly, like "Akash, we think all the time", but do you though? At least in my case, I feel like I barely had anything beyond transient, fleeting thoughts, or rather, _reactions_ to whatever nonsense it is that I was consuming. Whereas after this change, by virtue of not having my phone with me, I started noticing the people around me, the effect the weather had in how much I enjoyed the Japanese architecture outside the train windows, how the kids here spoke so differently than back home; and I started to really think about it all, about human nature, about some new technology I'd heard recently, all that stuff.

I mentioned earlier that my renewed desire (and ability) to read books was almost definitely a direct result of this exercise, and this is exactly what I meant. With all this new free time and desire to see, hear, _read_ new things, I found it in me to pick up books again, to really comprehend the words on the page beyond just their intended meaning, but also what I felt about it all on a deeper level.
