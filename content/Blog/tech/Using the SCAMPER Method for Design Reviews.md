## Introduction
_Feel free to skip this section if you don't care about the backstory_

Design reviews require significant time and effort, especially when UX considerations are still in their infancy at your company. This challenge is often heightened when developers, eager to learn and gain experience in user experience design, take on these responsibilities in addition to their existing roles (As is the case where I work). 

Here, our design review process is simple but somewhat messy:

1. Available team members are each assigned one or more screens (such as dialogs, components, etc.) of the target service.
2. Each member notes down any issues they notice (e.g., a button is misaligned, there are responsive resizing problems, etc.).
3. We create mockups for ideal or suggested fixes where applicable.
4. We return the review results, complete with mockups and explanations for our rationale, to the review requester.

While this process gets the job done, it leaves much to be desired. For one, it often takes too long for busy developers to go through each component, form item, contrast value, or dialog in the service to find UI/UX issues by gut instinct alone. We frequently find ourselves wondering, "What should I check next to find issues?" rather than asking, "What potential issue or improvement opportunity should I keep in mind while testing this screen?"

That's when I got to searching for a _"framework to success"_, if you will, to asking the right questions when reviewing a product; and I found the SCAMPER method - A 7-step ideation process that shines when identifying improvement opportunities in existing products and services. 

## How to SCAMPER?

SCAMPER is an acronym for the 7 key questions to consider when looking for areas of improvement in a product:
### 1. Substitute
__‚òÅÔ∏è‚ùì What can I substitute to improve my product?__

In "Substitute", we consider replacing existing elements or features with others. This allows for you to find new ways to solve current issues or improve user experience.
For example, Replace a text-based tutorial with an interactive guide
- Many users find it more efficient and easier to learn how to operate step-by-step on a real interface than to read lengthy texts. This eases the user's learning curve and increases engagement with a product
The key is to specifically think about the new value and experience that will be created by replacing the product, not just "replacing" it.
### 2. Combine
__‚òÅÔ∏è‚ùì Which elements can be combined to make your product or service more effective?__

For example, combine the navigation menu and search bar to allow users to quickly access the information they are looking for.
- Especially in mobile design, it is important to combine elements to provide a compact and efficient interface in order to make the most of limited screen space.
- Another approach is to combine a chatbot with a FAQ section to help users get the information they need more quickly. This is expected to reduce support costs and improve the user experience.
### 3. Adapt
__‚òÅÔ∏è‚ùì How can you take other best practices and contexts and apply them?__

In the "Adapt" step, we look at best practices in different environments and contexts and find ways to optimize them for our product or service. This will allow you to offer a more suitable user experience and reach new markets and user segments.
For example, optimizing a web-oriented application for smartphones
- Many web applications are designed for use on desktops and laptops, but many users prefer to use them on their smartphones. By adopting an ‚Äúadapt‚Äù mindset and optimizing your app for smartphones, you can significantly improve the user experience.
### 4. Modify
__‚òÅÔ∏è‚ùì What can be changed in the design, functionality, or process of the product to achieve better results?__

For example, change the colors and layout of the user interface to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- This can be something like adjusting the size and position of the Call-To-Action buttons may significantly improve click-through rates.
In addition, revamping existing flows and reducing unnecessary steps can help reduce the time it takes users to accomplish their objectives. This will make the user experience smoother and more satisfying.
### 5. Put to Other Uses
__üí≠‚ùî Are there ways in which existing elements or features can be put to other uses?__

The ‚ÄúPut to Other Uses‚Äù step considers ways to repurpose current products and features for different contexts and uses. This can open up new markets and user segments or enhance the value of existing products.
For example, leveraging chat functionality for uses other than customer support
- Chat functions are typically used for customer support and inquiry handling, but they can also be leveraged to gather product feedback.
- By providing ‚Äúin-app survey chats‚Äù that trigger specific operations or actions and collect real-time, in-the-moment feedback from users, valuable data can be collected to help improve products.
### 6. Eliminate
__üí≠‚ùî Which elements can be eliminated to make the product or service simpler and easier for users to use?__

For example, reduce user abandonment by reducing the number of required fields in the registration form. Especially when registering from a mobile device, it is important to minimize the amount of input required.
- Another possibility is to improve the experience of first-time visitors by trimming down the information on the top page of the application or website so that users can navigate intuitively.
### 7. Reverse, Rearrange
__üí≠‚ùî What new value can be created by changing the order or organization of elements?__

For example, Rearrange the arrangement of information to provide quick access to important information
- Many websites and applications arrange information on a single long page, which can make it time-consuming for users to find the information they need. Therefore, rethinking the prioritization of information and repositioning important information in a prominent position can improve the user experience.
- Also, in designing dashboards, the functions and important data that users use most frequently (e.g., real-time analytics and KPIs) should be displayed first, with detailed information and additional reports placed below them, so that users can instantly access the information they need most.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I mainly wanted to highlight a prescribed framework to asking important questions during design reviews, because I know firsthand that it's not so easy to recognize every issue through intuition alone.
Not only will you save valuable time doing this, you'll also cultivate good habits and reviewing skill by tuning your mind to look for key opportunities, even without following the SCAMPER method to a T.
That said, quick and clean isn't always the best approach to UX Reviews, and there
