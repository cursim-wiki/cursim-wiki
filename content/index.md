Welcome to my blog.

I'm Akash Bagchi. A 23 year old software developer currently living and working in Tokyo, Japan. You're currently seeing what I would sometimes refer to as a blog, sometimes as a wiki, and mostly as my **digital garden**.

I've been a huge proponent of organized note-taking for the longest time, although I admit it's more because I'm an aesthete, than because I'm organized.

I've jumped between dozens of different note-taking and agenda applications - from Notion to Todoist, physical journals and more; but nothing has ever really stuck because I've always foolishly tried to restrict it in scope - sometimes as a diary or journal, sometimes a to-do list, a budget, or maybe a poetry book.

This time though, I feel I've finally found a system that works for me, and that is to abandon attempt at labeling what this is or should be, and focusing solely on **networked thinking**.

I encourage anyone interested to start with [[Changelog | the Changelog]] and start exploring!
