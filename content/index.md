Welcome to my blog.

I'm Akash Bagchi. A software developer currently working in Tokyo, Japan.


At the time of writing, I'm planning to create a sort-of wiki to my professional and creative portfolio, as well as potentially use this as a knowledge-base for me to document and share the things I learn. But truth be told, only time will tell how this evolves.
